## How to run the app

Download the zip file using the green button, or clone the repository by running the command `git clone https://github.com/Nierowheezy/myshoppingcart` in your terminal.
In the same terminal once the command is complete, run `npm install` which will install all the dependencies in the `package.json` file and then run `npm start` which will start your development server on `localhost:3000`.
